## Goal

The objective of this tutorial was to introduce to the core programming concepts that will form the foundation of most of the apps we will build in the future. This app taught me a lot of important programming knowledge, while building a neat dice app.

## What I have created

We’re going to make a Las Vegas dice app. You can make the die roll at the press of a button or by shaking your phone. With this app in your pocket, you’ll be fully set up to settle any score on the go!

Las Vegas dice app with 2019/2020 design. Roll a dice project like I wrote on JavaScript, but this time on swift.
